# Web-scrapping

In this project done some web scrapping and scrapped the data from a online e-commerce site named Reliancedigital.com.</br>
This is a e-commerce site which sells all the digital techs such as laptops, mobile phones, television, washing machines, all kind of accessories etc.</br>
From this site I've scrapped the data of available Hp pavilion laptops their model no., price, discout price.</br>
Then this scrapped data is then saved in a csv file so that this file can be further used for analysis purpose.
